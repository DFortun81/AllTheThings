The Vale has great cultural importance to both the pandaren and mogu, particularly the Mogu'shan Palace. Formerly known as a Cradle of Life and used as a place of experimentation by the Titans similar to Sholazar Basin and Un'goro Crater, this vale of golden flowers and trees served as the seat of power for the rulers of Pandaria, such as Emperor Shaohao and the mogu rulers following the death of Lei Shen.|r",

It is seat of the Iron Horde's dominion over Draenor and home to the Bleeding Hollow clan, as well as the recently constructed Dark Portal that serves as a time-space gateway between Draenor and Azeroth. The Azerothian expedition mounts a counter-offensive against Iron Horde's operations in their homeworld in a desperate bid to shut down the gateway, with heavy losses that force the remnants to escape elsewhere in order to find allies.|r",

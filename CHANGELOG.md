[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.8...SL-2.3.9) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### Highlights of this update

- Fixed Settings page broken with 9.1 patch, you can click where you want to once again.
- If you have 'Report Quests' enabled, message in chat will be clickable now! This is super helpful if you report missing quests on our Discord because we will create copypastable report for you.

### Notable changes:

- Changed some logic so that when loading ATT (reload UI / login) the data will be loaded into the ATT windows after the loading screen has completed and the player is not in combat. Maybe this will fix some of the 'script ran too long' issues/disconnects that some users have been experiencing
- Fixed incomplete trackable Things not properly showing sometimes when using 'Show All Trackable Things'
- Due to some internal changes 'Show All Trackable Things' has been reset, you can turn it on again in Settings
- Some performance improvements
- More rare/Adventure drops, treasure/rare coordinates/descriptions, recipes, dailies, etc
- Various fixes

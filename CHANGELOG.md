### Dragonflight is here 🎉🔥🐲🐉

All Dragonflight content is marked collectible in AllTheThings as of this release 🎉

All your usual categories like Mounts, Achievements, Quests, etc and even expansion specific additions like Dragonriding customizations and Faction activities.

Most of the work this time around was done by @gbrage ♥

Because of the amount of content in new expansion we inevitably missed something so please come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/allthethings) to report issues you see!

Have a good time in Dragonflight 🔥

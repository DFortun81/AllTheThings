It is a vast area with majestic mountains, autumnal plains, and a lush coastal area. High atop the frigid northern peaks looms the Temple of the White Tiger, an ancient training ground protected by an elite force of martial priests, along with the spirit of the White Tiger itself, Xuen. Deeper into the mountains is the hideout of the Shado-pan clan: a mysterious order charged with protecting Pandaria from the dark things buried beneath its surface. When the isolated people of Kun-Lai are threatened by marauders from the west and a Zandalari troll menace invading its northern shores, they turn to the Alliance and Horde for help.",

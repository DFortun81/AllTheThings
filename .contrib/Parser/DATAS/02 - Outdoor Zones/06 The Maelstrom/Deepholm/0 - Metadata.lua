In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, Deepholm became accessible to players. It is the largest visitable level of the Elemental Plane, being a new questing, leveling and exploration zone tuned for level 30 players. It also holds a 5-man dungeon, the Stonecore. The two main enemy forces the player fight against are the Twilight's Hammer and a large tribe of stone troggs.",

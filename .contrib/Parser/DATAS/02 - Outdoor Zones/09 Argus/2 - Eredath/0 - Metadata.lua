The city's walkways were lined with precious minerals. Maatparm of Eredath cannot remember anymore how long it has been since he last was there. The eredar prior to their corruption by Sargeras seemed to have a great love and reverence for Eredath, as expressed on the inscription at the bottom of |cFFFFD700[The Last Relic of Argus]|r, 'I long for Eredath'.",
